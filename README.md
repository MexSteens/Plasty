# Plasty
This was my first proper web project. The front-end is made in VueJS with Bootstrap. The back-end REST API is made in Flask.

### Why did we make it?
This project was a school project. The module was called the "Design challenge". The purpose of this challenge was to develop an application or some technology which would be usefull for the human kind. You had complete freedom over the idea of your project and how you were going to make your project. One group made a teddy bear with some technology in it for small children, another group made a simple keychain which you could press and alarm someone. We made Plasty.

### What is Plasty?
The purpose of the application is to reduce plastic waste. The way I wanted to achieve this is by showing the products on the app which use a lot of excessive plastic packaging. Users can scan products which have a lot of excess plastic packaging and the more a product is scanned, the assumption is made that it has a lot of excess packaging so it will show up in the app.
(P.S. the app is also downloadable for any device).

### What did I learn?
Since this was my first proper web project, I learned a lot! I worked on the front-end and a fellow student worked on the back-end. At this point and time I was still figuring out wat an API even meant and how the web in itself worked. I did this project 10 weeks into my software engineering career for 2 weeks. I learned what a css framework is and how it worked. I learned about file structure with VueJS. I learned about working with components and how to pass data from and to other components. I learned about retrieving information from an API and lastly, I learned how to work with plugins.
